Task 1: SSH Commit Signature Verification

Commit signing proves who made code changes and that they weren't altered. It uses special digital signatures to confirm that a developer really created those commits and nobody secretly changed them. This stops people from pretending to be other team members, creates trust in team projects, and makes automated software pipelines safer. In DevOps workflows, where code moves quickly from writing to deployment, signed commits are important because they keep track of who did what and make sure only trusted changes get deployed.
