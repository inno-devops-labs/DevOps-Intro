# Lab 1 Submission
## Task 1 SSH Commit Signature Verification:
The signature of commits provides a cryptographic guarantee of authorship and code integrity, preventing forgery of commits and protecting against the introduction of malicious changes on someone else's behalf. In DevOps practices, this is critically important, since CI/CD systems trust only verified commits for automatic builds and deployments, which creates an additional level of security in the software supply chain. Signed commits also ensure compliance with security standards, provide an auditable trace of changes, and are displayed on platforms like GitHub with the "Verified" label, increasing trust in the code in team and open-source development.

PR templates standardize the code review process, forcing developers to describe changes in a structured manner. All PRS receive the same sections ("Purpose", "Changes", "Testing"), which saves reviewers time — they do not need to search for information in chaotic descriptions. Checklists automatically remind you of important actions.: tests, documentation, code style. In distributed teams, templates compensate for the lack of personal communication — a reviewer in a different time zone receives all the necessary information without additional questions.

Challenges emerged during setup. I have some problem, while do Signing keys.
