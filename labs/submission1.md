### 1.1 Summary of Commit Signing Benefits

The signature of commits is important because it is a digital signature that confirms that it was I who made the commit and my code was not changed after sending it.

**Why is commit signing important in DevOps workflows?**

In DevOps, processes are automated: code is automatically included in testing, assembly, and production. Signed commits guarantee that no unconfirmed code will leak into the automatic pipeline.
