# Lab 1 — Submission

## Task 1 — SSH Commit Signing

### Why signed commits are important

Signed commits help verify that changes were made by a trusted author
and that the commit history was not altered. This is important in
DevOps workflows because it increases security, accountability,
and trust in collaborative environments.

### Proof of SSH signing

The commit "docs: explain importance of signed commits" was created
using SSH commit signing. On GitHub, this commit is marked with
a green "Verified" badge, confirming the authenticity of the author.

## Task 2 — Pull Request Template

### PR template description

A pull request template was added to the main branch of the repository.
It includes sections for Goal, Changes, and Testing, as well as a
checklist to ensure clear PR titles, updated documentation, and
absence of sensitive data.

### Proof of PR template usage

A pull request from `feature/lab1` to `main` was created in my fork.
The PR description was automatically populated using the pull request template.
The checklist items were completed, demonstrating standardized PR workflow.
